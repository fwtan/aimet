AIMET Installation
###################

Release packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AIMET release packages are hosted at https://github.com/quic/aimet/releases. Each release includes multiple python packages of the following format:

.. code-block::

    <PACKAGE_PREFIX>-<VARIANT>_<VERSION>-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl

Please find more information below about each *VARIANT*.

PyTorch

#. **torch-gpu** for PyTorch 1.13 GPU package with Python 3.8 and CUDA 11.x - *Recommended for use* with PyTorch models
#. **torch-cpu** for PyTorch 1.13 CPU package with Python 3.8 - If installing on a machine without CUDA
#. **torch-gpu-pt19** for PyTorch 1.9 GPU package with Python 3.8 and CUDA 11.x
#. **torch-cpu-pt19** for PyTorch 1.9 CPU package with Python 3.8 - If installing on a machine without CUDA


TensorFlow

#. **tf-gpu** for TensorFlow 2.10 GPU package with Python 3.8 - *Recommended for use* with TensorFlow models
#. **tf-cpu** for TensorFlow 2.10 CPU package with Python 3.8 - If installing on a machine without CUDA

ONNX

#. **onnx-gpu** for ONNX 1.11.0 GPU package with Python 3.8 - *Recommended for use* with ONNX models
#. **onnx-cpu** for ONNX 1.11.0 CPU package with Python 3.8 - If installing on a machine without CUDA

System Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AIMET package requires the following host platform setup:

* 64-bit Intel x86-compatible processor
* Linux Ubuntu: 20.04 LTS
* bash command shell
* For GPU variants:
    * Nvidia GPU card (Compute capability 5.2 or later)
    * nvidia-docker - Installation instructions: https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker

To use the GPU accelerated training modules an Nvidia CUDA enabled GPU with a minimum Nvidia driver version of 455+ is required. Using the latest driver is always recommended, especially if using a newer GPU. Both CUDA and cuDNN (the more advanced CUDA interface) enabled GPUs are supported.

Recommended host system hardware requirements:

* Intel i7 multicore CPU w/hyperthreading
* 16+ GB RAM
* 500GB+ SSD hard drive
* For GPU variants:
    * GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 or Tesla V100

While these are not minimum requirements, they are recommended for good performance when training large networks.

Installation Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two ways to setup and install AIMET:
    * On your host machine
    * Using our pre-built development `Docker images <https://artifacts.codelinaro.org/ui/native/codelinaro-aimet/aimet-dev>`_
